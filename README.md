# ShoppingList_App
The purpose of this application is to allow me to list all the things I need todo for any selected day.   
Use a date picker UI control to chose a day to see my grocery list.  
If there is nothing in localStorage, then make a fetch (or axios) call to data.json on your localhost (in the same folder that has your application.)

In this homework assignment, you must use all these technologies;
CSS
HTML 5.0
Javascript (ES6)

The app run (and look acceptable on a mobile phone), then run it on the desktop. 
This assignment is a 'mobile-first' design.
This application loads a data file ('data.json') if there is nothing in the localStorage for your selected day.   
If the data is found in localStorage, you should always interact and use it (including updates).
