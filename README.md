# ShoppingList_App
The purpose of this application is to allow users to list all the things they need todo for any selected day.   
Use a date picker UI control to chose a day to see user's grocery list.  
If there is nothing in localStorage, then make a fetch (or axios) call to data.json on the localhost (in the same folder that has my application.)

In this application, I use all these technologies: CSS, HTML 5.0, Javascript (ES6)

The app run (and look acceptable on a mobile phone), then run it on the desktop. 
This app is a 'mobile-first' design.
This application loads a data file ('data.json') if there is nothing in the localStorage for user's selected day.   
If the data is found in localStorage, I always interact and use it (including updates).
